TODO
====

Here's a list of things I'd like to add to this utility. No specific order; except ones that seem more interesting or useful to me are higher up.

* User config file: stores the user's preferences for how their music collection will be ordered and such. Something like .audioorg
	* Things to contain: path to user's music collection, how many padding zeroes should be added to track numbers, how to handle double albums, how to handle compilations, etc.
* Updating the user's music player's database?
* Unit testing?
* Automatically getting/adding metadata to audio files before moving them into the audio library.
* Automatic song/album title capitalization correction?
* General code cleanliness, modularity, etc.
	* Module for storing the equivalent tag keys in different formats (M4A's 'soar' == MP3's 'title' etc.)
* GUI
