TODO
====

Here's a list of things I'd like to add to this utility. No specific order; except ones that seem more interesting or useful to me are higher up.

* User config file: stores user preferences as to library format, padding zeroes, etc., in YAML.
* Updating the user's music player's database?
* Unit testing?
* Automatically getting/adding metadata to audio files before moving them into the audio library.
* Automatic song/album title capitalization correction?
* GUI
