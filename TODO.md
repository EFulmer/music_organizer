TODO

Here's a list of things I'd like to add to this utility. No specific order; except ones that seem more interesting or useful to me are higher up.

* User config file: stores user preferences as to file structure.
	* Things to contain: path to user's music collection, how many padding zeroes should be added to track numbers, how to handle double albums, how to handle compilations, etc.
* Updating the user's music player's database?
* Unit testing?
* Automatically getting/adding metadata to audio files before moving them into the audio library.
* Automatic song/album title capitalization correction?
* GUI
